### MDP Explanation

4 Actions: Left, Down, Right, Up

States are represented in training as numbers, but in the environment they are represented as:
    (X, Y, W-MASK, AVAIL-ACTION-MASK)

Where X and Y are the tile's position

W-MASK is a bit mask indicating if it's a water tile (1) or not
And Avail-Action-Mask is a bit mask indicating what actions are available at that position.

So, 1111 means all actions are available,
1010, means that the agent can go left and right, but not up or down.
