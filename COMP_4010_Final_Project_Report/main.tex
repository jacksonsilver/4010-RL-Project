\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Problem Focus}
This project will focus on solving the puzzle game "Thin Ice" from Club Penguin using Reinforcement Learning. Thin Ice is a grid-based game where a player navigates a maze to  reach a target tile. A unique aspect of the game that adds more technicality is that each floor tile melts when stepped on, preventing tiles from being revisited and forcing the player to think carefully about the path they take to reach the target tile. 
Our main goal is to train an RL agent to complete the different Thin Ice levels we have provided by reaching the target tile without drowning. Our agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. We have different tiles in the environment: floor tiles (which the agent can walk on), wall tiles (which block movement), water tiles (which floor tiles turn into when stepped on by the agent and cause the agent to drown when the tile is revisited), and a target tile (the goal tile). In addition to reaching the target tile, we make our project more challenging by having another goal for our agent. In Thin Ice, players get the highest score by stepping on every floor tile on their path to the destination.
