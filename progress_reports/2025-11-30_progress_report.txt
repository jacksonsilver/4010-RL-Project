November 30th Progress Report

Progress in Past 2 Weeks:

Alexis


Jackson
- Added DQL Algorithm
- Added level with hard ice - tile that can be walked on more than once
- Modified MDP to accomodate hard ice - state representation is x, y, and the tile types of the 3x3 grid surrounding player
- Implemented comparison of DQL algorithm with different training values

Kinjal
- Updated the final report to mainly include text on approaches, review of prior work on algorithms, and justification of these approaches

Lujain
- Generated loss graph for training, to make sure loss decreases as training goes on
- Implemented a decaying entropy, so that it converges at the end, and not too early
- Debugging PP
- Tested with different reward structures to see how it effects training

Trista


Main Accomplishment: 

Goals for this week:
- Compare algorithms correctness, and on different training values.
- Create faster testing for DQL (current testing is too slow, use subprocesses)
- Add findings to report
