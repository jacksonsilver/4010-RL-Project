November 30th Progress Report

Progress in Past 2 Weeks:

Alexis


Jackson
- Added DQL Algorithm
- Added level with hard ice - tile that can be walked on more than once
- Modified MDP to accomodate hard ice - state representation is x, y, and the tile types of the 3x3 grid surrounding player
- Implemented comparison of DQL algorithm with different training values

Kinjal
- Updated the final report to mainly include text on approaches, review of prior work on algorithms, and justification of these approaches

Lujain


Trista


Main Accomplishment: 

Goals for next 2 weeks: 
- Compare algorithms correctness, and on different training values.
- Create faster testing for DQL (current testing is too slow, use subprocesses)
- Add findings to report
