November 15th Progress Report

Progress in Past 2 Weeks:

Alexis
Worked on the introduction section of the Project Report

Jackson

Kinjal
- Worked briefly on DQN implementation to see if tweaking reward and step structure can help agent to train on certain levels better, expect to further work on this
- Added logic to refine the policy plot visualized for each level (path does not include tiles not visited), refactored to work without w_mask
- Started work on the Project Report and expect to further work on this

Lujain
- Implemented PPO using Mlp (after training - realized it did not work properly)
- Ended up implementing PPO using CNN, works a lot better but only on smaller levels, working on this more for the next week.
- Generation of Graphs of rewards vs epsiode number (show that it converges)
- Renamed all the places files were being generated - so they arent everywhere
- created a "main" file, just to make it look neater (better UI)


Trista

Main Accomplishment: 

Goals for next 2 weeks: 
- Research more about optimizing PPO, since it only works on "simpler" levels, maybe changing reward structure, hyperparamaters, certain implementation,etc
-
